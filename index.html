        <center>My favorite vacation spot is vizag</center>
    </h3>
    <p>
        One of the oldest port cities of <b>India</b>, Vizag is located at the heart of Andhra Pradesh.
        <i>The city got its name from Lord Visakheswara Temple which is now located beneath the seawaters.</i>
        The place is famous for the picturesque landscapes and serene beaches which makes it one of the liked
        places to visit for coastal vacations.
        The places I like in vizag are:<br><br>
        <b> Araku Valley</b><br>
        <b>Borra Caves</b><br>
        <b>Katiki Waterfalls</b><br>
        <b>RK Beach</b>
