    <h3>My favorite food is Dosa</h3>
    <p>
        Dosa is a thin, crispy Indian food loved by many. It's simple, made with basic ingredients, and has a tasty,
        slightly bitter flavor. You can enjoy it as a snack, for breakfast, or whenever you want a yummy, savory meal!

        <b>Regular dosa</b> — Made up of a simple base of rice and lentil flour.</br>
        <b>Neer dosa</b> — The word neer literally means water in the Tulu language. Neer dosa batter is made from rice
        flour
        from Mangalore; the texture is watery and not thick like a typical dosa batter.</br>
